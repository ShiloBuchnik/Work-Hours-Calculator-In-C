## This is a small calculator, that takes your work hours and hourly pay as input, and outputs your expected salary
  
This program uses a save file to save your hours, and lets you add to that save file as the work month progresses  
When prompt to calculate, it asks for hourly pay and asks if to deduce 30 minute breaks  
In return, it outputs the sum of hours, sum of overtime, and the expected salary  
  
It utilizes Windows' API to enable ANSI escape sequences (thus, enabling colored printing)
