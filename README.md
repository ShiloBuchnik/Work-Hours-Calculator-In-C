This program uses a save file to save your hours, and lets you add to that save file as the work month progresses  
When prompt to calculate, it asks for hourly pay and asks if to deduce 30 minutes breaks  
In return, it outputs the sum of hours, sum of overtime, and the expected salary  
  
It utilizes Windows' API to enable ANSI escape sequences (thus, enabling colored printing)

It was made in my spare time to help me keep track of my work hours
